                <p class="about-me">HEY, you! I'm Cara! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
                
                <p class="about-me">I am an amateur web developer hailing from Denver, CO, the Mile High City.
                    I grew up in Syracuse, NY and got my B.S. in Neuroscience at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI.
                    After spending some time working for a start-up in the medical device industry, I decided
                    to take my skills to a completely different industry in Park City, UT where I instructed skiing.
                    How did it go? Swimmingly, in that I am a snowboarder who learned how to ski on the job,
                    leading me to take on more of a babysitter role than that of an instructor.
                    After taking a year-long hiatus from the West back in Syracuse as a chemist in an environmental lab,
                    I packed my car and landed in Denver after spending an arm and a leg on gas while meandering around the country.</p>

                <p class="about-me">My hobbies include coding, rock climbing, reading, listening to house music, and dropping things.</p>

                <p class="about-me">Don't be shy! Shoot me a message!</p>
